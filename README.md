Notes App

<b> Problem Statement: </b>

Teacher write very fast and give some assignments so for that we need a app that can hold the image of white board and can store text related to that class.

<b> Proposed Solution : </b>

Its features include that we can change the color of cards for different-different class and we can search the card by title, sub title and it can store images,links, and text in a note.

- Constraint Layout : Most of the activities in the app uses a flexible constraint layout, which is easy to handle for different screen sizes.
- Simple & Easy Views Design : Use of familiar audience EditText with hints and interactive buttons made it easier for students. Apps also uses App Navigation to switch between different screens.
- RecyclerView : To present the list we used the efficient recyclerview.
- LiveData & Room Database : We are using Room Database to save notes and LiveData is used for search view.

<b> Application Link & Future Scope : </b>

The app is currently in the Alpha testing phase with BKBIET institute with a limited no. of users, You can access the app : [APP LINK HERE](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cr0GyyCmGZIkHASCTT7vC7Ss8DJlFpZe/view?usp=sharing).

Once the app is fully tested and functional in BKBIET institute, we plan to talk to neighboring colleges also to propose this app idea and collaborate with them on this.
